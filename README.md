MongoDB for database
Express for backend
React for frontend
Node.js

I used free DB on MongoDB (for security reasons), so if the app has not been used for a month, then the DB will not work.

To run, download and open in your favorite IDE. 
Run 'yarn start' in one terminal to start the backend.
Navigate to api folder and run 'node index.js' to start the frontend.
